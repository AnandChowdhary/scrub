With Scrub, you can easily track errors and send them to your backend.

## ‚≠ê Getting started

Install Scrub as a dependency:

```bash
npm install scrub-js
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add scrub-js
```

Then import the library:

```js
import Scrub from "scrub-js";
```

And initialize it with your settings:

```js
const scrub = new Scrub({ endpoint: "https://example.com/track" });
```

You can also use a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/scrub"></script>
```

Now, your errors are tracked. Try it with `throw new Error("Example error");`.
